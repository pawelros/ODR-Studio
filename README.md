# ODR-Studio

ODR-Studio is a very basic (yet) concept of free, scallable, cross platform, responsive DAB+ studio web application. The idea is quite simple - to create a web app, that together with Open Digital Radio great tools will bring you a real radio studio experience and all of that directly from your browser.

* Step by step further VLC functionality
* Standalone web stream proxy in order to never turn down fdk-aac-dabplus encoder
* Support multiple audio sources and mix them in realtime, into web stream proxy (JACK maybe?)
* And many, many more
